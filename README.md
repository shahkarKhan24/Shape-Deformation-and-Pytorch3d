<h2>Generating a 2D dataset from a target mesh</h2>
• Implementing 3D deformation using 2D guidance
• Introducing adversarial loss while mesh deformation
with 2D images
• Introducing attention layer into discriminator model
to get more accurate result. Self-attention mechanisms capture dependencies between pixels or regions, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts
of the input.
• Visualizing and analyzing the result of all the approaches while also evaluating their losses.
