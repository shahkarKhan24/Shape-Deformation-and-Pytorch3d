<h2>Generating a 2D dataset from a target mesh</h2>

Implementing 3D deformation using 2D guidance

Introducing adversarial loss while mesh deformation with 2D images.

Introducing the attention layer into the discriminator model to get more accurate results. Self-attention mechanisms capture dependencies between pixels or regions, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.

Visualizing and analyzing the result of all the approaches while also evaluating their losses.
